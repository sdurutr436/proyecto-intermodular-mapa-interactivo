## Detailed Problem Description
Many students and people interested in languages face difficulties relating words with their translations in different countries in a visual and contextual way. Traditional translation tools are usually linear or word lists, making it difficult to understand the geographical distribution of languages. Additionally, conventional maps show geographical information, but rarely allow integrating translated textual content directly within each country.

## Target Users (User Personas)
- **Language students (16-25 years):** Seek interactive tools that help them learn vocabulary in different languages while understanding geographical distribution.  
- **Teachers and educators:** Need visual and didactic resources to teach languages and culture in a more attractive way.  
- **Culture and linguistics enthusiasts:** People who want to explore languages in a fun and visual way.

## Research Evidence
- **Observations:**   
Existing tools show translations in text or separate applications, but do not integrate map + translation simultaneously.

#### Comparative Tools

1. **European Word Translator**  
   Allows translating words from English to over 30 European languages and displays results on an interactive map. However, it is limited to a single word per country and does not offer complete translations or additional context. Our project seeks to translate complete phrases or texts integrated in a map, thus offering a richer and more contextualized experience.

2. **Map Translator**  
   Converts textual content into symbolic representations on a map. Focuses more on symbolic visualization than on direct linguistic translation. Our project focuses on accurate and contextualized translations within the interactive map.

3. **Textomap**  
   Allows creating custom interactive maps from textual content, supporting multiple languages. It does not focus on text translation or deep linguistic integration. Our project combines accurate translation with geographical representation on an interactive map.

4. **Interactive Language World Map**  
   Shows an interactive map where possible communication is visualized according to spoken languages. Visually attractive, but does not offer translations or detailed linguistic context. Our project provides complete and accurate translations within the map, enriching the educational experience.


## Competition Analysis
- **Google Translate:** Excellent for individual translations, but does not integrate geographical context.  
- **Duolingo:** Gamification of learning, but does not offer world map visualization.  
- **Comparative tools:** Already detailed in the previous point.
> None of these tools combine **automatic translation + dynamic geographical visualization**, leaving a space for a novel product.

## Value Proposition
Create an **interactive world map** where users can enter any word and see it automatically translated within each country according to its official language. This combines **language learning, geographical visualization and interactive experience**, offering a unique, intuitive and attractive educational tool for students, teachers and linguistics enthusiasts.
